# Ajax-Request-to-API-Demonstration

This app demonstrates the use of ajax requests to retrieve data from a public api.

The data is retrieved in the form of a JSON object and parsed.

The app is written in JavaScript using a NodeJS runtime. 

The app makes requests to a NASA api to retrieve links to photography from current and previous Mars Rovers and displays the images from a selected date.
